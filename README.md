# Is Admin?

Very simply returns a boolean if the user is running the program as admin.

Currently only works on Windows and \*NIX systems.

## Examples

### Running without admin

```shell
cargo run --example printadmin

Is the user an admin? false
```

```shell
sudo cargo run --example printadmin

Is the user an admin? true
```
